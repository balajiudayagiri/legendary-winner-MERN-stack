        <h1>History of java</h1>
        <p>The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was
            too
            advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with
            the Green
            Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital
            devices
            such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming. Later, Java
            technology
            was incorporated by Netscape.

            The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured,
            High
            Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic". Java was
            developed by
            James Gosling, who is known as the father of Java, in 1995. James Gosling and his team members started the
            project in
            the early '90s.</p>
